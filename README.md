## TODO:
####    Drive:
- [ ] Linking PCB Build
- [ ] Get the damn parts

####    Power:
- [ ] Power Regulation and Distribution block: A block that takes in 12V and 
outputs every power connection. Includes Battery voltage monitoring and cutoff. Uses an arduino to transmit data.

####    Signals:
- [ ] Encoder Handling
- [ ] GPS Handling
- [ ] Lidar Handling
- [ ] MPU-9250 Integration
- [ ] I2C Rail

####    Software:
- [ ] Sensor Interface
- [ ] Proper Mapping
- [ ] Autonomous
- [ ] Low Level -> High Level Interface
- [ ] A* Path Finding and Following
- [ ] SLAM (See [BreezySLAM](https://github.com/simondlevy/breezyslam))
- [ ] Robot Dashboard
- [ ] Drive Integration
- [ ] Arm Integration

####    Expansion:
- [ ] Find out how to enable expansion

####    Comms:
- [ ] Local Communication (Drive -> Pi <- PDB)
- [ ] Remote Communication (Pi -> Driver Station)
- [ ] Long-Term Data Storage (Maps, Logs, etc.)

####    Base:
- [ ] Get the damn base
- [ ] Expandability Standard
